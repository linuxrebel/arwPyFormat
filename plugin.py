"""autopep8 as a tool.

Style findings need no model. autopep8 fixes them deterministically, cannot
alter the code either side of the whitespace, and does the whole file in one
subprocess instead of one model call per finding.

Deliberately NOT black: black reformats the entire file to its own opinion,
which produces a 40-line diff for an 11-line problem. That unrequested scope
is the exact failure this project keeps running into. autopep8 fixes actual
PEP 8 violations and leaves everything else alone.
